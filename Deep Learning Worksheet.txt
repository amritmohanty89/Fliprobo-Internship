11) Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks.

12) Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward. Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

13) Machine learning uses algorithms to parse data, learn from that data, and make informed decisions based on what it has learned
 

Deep learning structures algorithms in layers to create an "artificial neural network” that can learn and make intelligent decisions on its own
 

Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning. While both fall under the broad category of artificial intelligence, deep learning is what powers the most human-like artificial intelligence

14) Perceptrons can be viewed as building blocks in a single layer in a neural network, made up of four different parts:
Input Values or One Input Layer
Weights and Bias
Net sum
Activation function

15)  AI is a bigger concept to create intelligent machines that can simulate human thinking capability and behavior, whereas, machine learning is an application or subset of AI that allows machines to learn from data without being programmed explicitly.
